<!-- About Biggest Break -->
<section>
    <div class="section-title center">A Break From Cancer Can Make a Difference</div>
    <div class="section-break center"></div>
    <div class="section-text center">
        <p>We will all be touched by cancer at some point.</p>

        <p>For those diagnosed, the journey is emotionally and physically draining and one you must
        face with strength and determination. For the caregivers and the family members, it is a
        complex rollercoaster of emotions where you often feel broken, lost and alone.</p>

        <p>The Biggest Break strives to create an experience where our guests’ rediscover who they
        were before cancer entered their lives. They can pretend for just a moment that their lives
        are without challenges and celebrate each day.</p>

        <p>The Biggest Break will give back the ability to be a family again – instead of a family
        with cancer.</p>

        <p>It is our wish that each of our guests on their break get the chance to laugh a little
        louder, hug a little more and recognize that love defines their life story, not cancer.</p>

        <p>And most importantly, it is about building up strength and spirit to fight what lay
        ahead. To cross the finish line together – and realise that cancer won’t define you.</p>

        <p>It is thanks to the generosity of so many accommodation providers in the Margaret River
        Region that this event is possible.</p>
