            <div class="section-title center">A break from cancer can make a difference</div>
            <div class="section-content center">
                <p>We will all be touched by cancer at some point.</p>

                <p>For those diagnosed, the journey is emotionally and physically draining and one you
                must face with strength and determination. For the caregivers and the family
                members, it is a complex rollercoaster of emotions where you often feel broken, lost
                and alone.</p>

                <p>The Biggest Break strives to create an experience where our guests’ rediscover who
                they were before cancer entered their lives. They can pretend for just a moment that
                their lives are without challenges and celebrate each day.</p>

                <p>The Biggest Break will give back the ability to be a family again – instead of a family
                with cancer.</p>

                <p>It is our wish that each of our guests on their break get the chance to laugh a little
                louder, hug a little more and recognize that love defines their life story, not cancer.</p>

                <p>And most importantly, it is about building up strength and spirit to fight what lay
                ahead. To cross the finish line together – and realise that cancer won’t define you.</p>

                <p>It is thanks to the generosity of so many accommodation providers in the Margaret
                River Region that this event is possible.</p>
